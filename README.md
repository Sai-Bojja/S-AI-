Basic Google and GPT-Powered Chatbot. 

Just an elementary version, can be developed to good use. Nothing Ground-breaking but for me it is. 

Basic idea:

1. BOT receives the Query.
2. Uses a personal search engine to search the query.
3. Sees if the question can be answered with the snippets. 
4. Scrape the contents from the top 10 links and summarize.
5. Provide this content to GPT, GPT understands the content and answers according to the question.
6. If content is not enough GPT uses its own knowledge to answer the question.
